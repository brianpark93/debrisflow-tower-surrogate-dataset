# Full Dataset for ML Surrogate Modeling of Debris Flow Impact on a Transmission Tower

This repository provides the full dataset used for training and evaluating the machine learning surrogate model presented in the paper:

"AI Surrogate for Debris Flow Impact on a Transmission Tower Using SPH–FEM Simulations"

The dataset is derived from high-fidelity coupled Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations of debris flow impacts on a full-scale transmission tower. It includes the input variables, the corresponding simulation-based true outputs, and the predicted outputs obtained from the optimal proposed model, together with the training and testing split information.

## Dataset

The dataset is provided as a single CSV file.

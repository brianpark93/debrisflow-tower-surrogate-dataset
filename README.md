# AI Surrogate Dataset for Debris Flow Impact on a Transmission Tower

This repository provides the SPH–FEM simulation dataset used in the paper:

"AI Surrogate for Debris Flow Impact on a Transmission Tower Using SPH–FEM Simulations"

The dataset was generated from high-fidelity coupled Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations of debris flow impacts on a full-scale transmission tower.
